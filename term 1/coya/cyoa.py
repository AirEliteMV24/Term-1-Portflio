----------------------------------------------------
You are about to find yourself trapped in a strange
and dangerous island on one of the most forbidding
planets in the galaxy: Tenopia. It's important that
you follow the directions in this book if you hope
to escape!

During your travels on Tenopia lsland, you'll have a
small computer that can project a map of the region
you're in at any moment. To use this, flip to the map
page indicated near the bottom of the page you're
reading. Whether or not you escape from Tenopia
Island will depend on how skilIful you are, how
persistant you are, and how lucky you are. Will you
succeed - or will you be trapped forever? lt's
entirely up to you!""")


page1="""
   While you are traveling on a diplomatic mission
from Earth to the Mylaean Cluster, your spaceship is
hit by a meteor. With seconds to spare, you jettison
in an escape pod, the only survivor. The pod's
built-in computer indicates there is only enough
fuel to reach Tenopia, the fifth planet of Star
System Tenopia. The computer's memory bank supplies
you with the following information:

            TENOPIA: 4/5 Earth size; rotation 26
            hours; sun rises in the east, sets in
            west; revolution: 587 days; air quality
            excellent; food and water abundant;
            surface 80% ocean with one large island
            (Tenopia lsland) and a single continent 
            (Kabran); ocean is subject to violent
            storms; galactic language widely spoken;
            technology generally medieval; travel
            dangerous and not advised.
              
   Bracing yourseIf for entry into Tenopia's
atmosphere, you examine your only survival equipment
- pocket-sized computer that is programmed to
project a map of your region at all times on a small
video screen.
   Suddenly, on the pod's computer, you read:
   
        Entry Phase: landing targeted near
        Krelia, west coast of Tenopia lsland.
        
   A moment later the words "Tenopia Island" appear, 
and this aerial view is displayed:"""

   Your tiny craft sets down with a sharp jolt. You
lie dazed for a few minutes before you can pull
yourseIf together. By the time you crawl through the
hatch, your pod is already surrounded by giant
haIf-human creatures with huge forked hands. They
blindfold you and lead you along a winding bumpy
surface, then down a long ladder that leads deep
underground. At last they remove your blindfold. You
are in a huge dimly lit cavern that reeks of suIfurous
fumes.
   The creatures search you. You hold your breath
when they find your computer. But they toss it aside
as a useless ornament, and you're able to retrieve
it a few moments later.
   You quickly learn that your captors are
crogocides and that you have been condemned to
slavery in their krelium mine. Closely watched by
crogocide guards wielding long spiked sticks, you
are forced to chip and shovel krelium ore for seven
hours before you're allowed to rest for the night.
   Most of the slaves speak the galactic language,
and during the days that follow you make friends
with Prespar, an old hominid from a nearby planet.
He looks almost as human as yourseIf.
   When you ask whether there is any hope of escape
from the mine, Prespar merely shakes his head. But
that night, while there are no crogocides nearby, he
comes to you and whispers, "There is a secret tunnel
that leads to the surface. Tomorrow I will show you
the slab that hides the entrance."
    "How do I get to the nearest galactic patrol
station?" you whisper back."""

   A few minutes later, three crogocides seize you.
Blindfolded, hands tied behind your back, you're
transported by cart and by boat and again by cart to
the krelium mine. There you are set to the same
grueling work-chipping and shoveling, chippin and
shoveling.
   This time you're watched more closely than ever
by the crogocide guards. Several days pass before
you have a chance to pull back the slab covering the
secret tunnel.
   Your heart is in your mouth because you're afraid
you'll find the passageway sealed off. But it's
still open! Soon you're standing once again on the
surface ofTenopia! You're only at the beginning of
your journey, but at least you know a lot more than
before."""

   Once again you have reached the encampment of the
red-winged bird people.
   Kumba steps forward and greets you. "We had hoped
you would be well on your way to Zindor by now."
   "It doesn't look as if I'm making very good
progress," you say.
   Kumba rests a wing on your shoulder. "I think
you'll have better luck if you head south to the
Rapoor River. The crogocides are gone, and the
southern route is clear now. I can show you the way

   "Thanks, I'll try it," you quickly reply."""

approach it, you are alarmed by screams and sounds
of fighting."""
#If you have been to Anarchia before, turn to page 23.
page9_2='''
   Keeping carefully out of sight, you look for a
road leading out of town. Rocks rain down from the
roof of a house. You duck into an alley, almost
colliding with a bird child who looks so much like a
big parrot that you want to laugh.
   Apparently the child thinks you're funny, because
he laughs. "My name is Nem," he says. "You are in
Anarchia - the worst place on Tenopia lsland. If you
don't leave in a hurry, you won't survive."
   "Well, how do I leave?"'''                  
#turn to page 12

   "First you must escape from this island. You'll
have a long and difficult journey," says Prespar,
"much too long for these old bones. The only station
is on Kabran, which lies on the other side of an
ocean subject to storms so violent they sink every
ship that tries to cross it."
   "Then how can I get there?"
   "Only by balloon. And the only balloon on Tenopia 
lsland is possessed by my friend Kin Rugg, who lives
far to the east in a tiny village beyond Lake
Shonra. lt's called Zindor, but you'll not find it
on any map; the crogocides have never dared to go
near there."
   "Will Kin Rugg take me to Kabran?"
   Prespar nods. "I once saved his life, and he
promised to do any favor I asked. I'll give you a
letter to bring to him. He will understand that I am
too old to go."
   "Thank you a thousand times, Prespar. Is there
anything else I should know?""
   Prespar looks anxiously around. "You will
encounter many creatures on this island, some
friendly, some dangerous. You can trust the bird
people - they do not fly, but their wings are like
feathered hands, as nimble as yours and mine. Look
for the prince of Agron. He will help you. Most of
all, beware of the crogocides! They enslave every
hominid that can hold a shovel and swing a pick."'''
#Turn to page 11

   "How can I travel about?"
   "The crogocides ride zekees, shaggy animals with
curved horns, but you will probably have to walk, 
unless you can get aboard a coastal ship at one of
the seaports." Again Prespar looks nervously around.
"Oh, one thing more- never, never set foot on Cape
Moril"
  "Where's that?"
   Suddenly Prespar turns away. Two guards are 
approaching. You quickly pretend to be asleep, 
resolving that before another day passes you will be
free.'''

   Beckoning you to follow, Nem leads you through
twisting alleys to the edge of town. The road ahead
branches into two trails.
   "The trail to the east is very dangerous," he
tells you. "it leads through the Land of the Diving
Birds. it would be safer to take the road leading
south."'''

   Early the next morning, at a moment when no
guards are looking, Prespar pulls back the slab that
hides the entrance to the secret tunnel. You quickly
shake his hand and slip through the narrow opening.
After a long and difficult climb in total darkness,
you reach the surface and gratefully breathe the
fresh clean air. A dirt road stretches out like a
ribbon in both directions. A warm breeze is blowing.
Birds are singing. You feel encouraged.
   The landscape is covered with lush plains bearing
tiny flowers that are tinted by the glow from the
huge orange sun. Though four or five times as big in
the sky as the Earth's sun, you can look right at it
without hurting your eyes! 
   Holding your computer, you display a map of the
region. You can see that the road leads to the
northeast through open meadows, to the south through
dense forest. You're inclined to go northeast
becauseyour goal, Zindor, lies to the east. But it
might be wise to go south; the forest would give you
better protection from any pursuing guards"""

   You are drawn to the sound, but before you can
reach its source, two bird people with dark red
wings spring from behind a tree. The music stops,
and in a moment a dozen more bird people gather
around you. They seem friendly, and you waste no
time in telling them of your quest for Zindor.
   Their leader, Kumba Matata, listens attentively.
"You wish to go to Zindor? I can only tell you this.

of Lake Shonra, you will see a signpost with three
signs. Follow the sign that is most different from
the other two."'''

   The people seem friendly, but they will not

find your way to the docks. A bird man wearing a

end of the island by traveling farther up the coast. 
   "What about Agron, to the northeast of here?" you
ask, after consulting your map.

this fortress, Zindor is the only place on the
island that is safe from the crogocides. It lies
nestled in the lava fields on the eastern slopes of
the great Keona Volcano. Although the volcano has
been dormant for many years, it rumbles and smokes
from time to time, and the crogocides are afraid to
go near it."
   "How would one reach the volcano?" you ask.
   "Well," says the prince, scratching his furry
chin, "the volcano lies far to the southeast of
here, beyond Cerzan. But if you go southeast, you
risk being captured by crogocides. It would be safer

great blue bird, larger than any you have seen on

replies. "But the bridge is guarded by crogocides,

flow is a tiny village. A large balloon rises from

triangularheaded creature staring at you from the

creatures live solely on ammonia. Their habitat is
limited to a few places where no other creature
would survive.
   Another volca quickly joins the first. Swinging
their powerful tails down into the pit, they swiftly
